# Three-wheel-car-detection
This project focuses on detecting three-wheel cars using deep learning and computer vision techniques. Leveraging the powerful RetinaNet architecture with a ResNet-50 backbone, the model is trained to accurately identify three-wheel vehicles in images and videos. 
Here's a sample **README** for your three-wheel car detection project based on the structure of the provided folder:

## Features  

- **Model Architecture**: RetinaNet with ResNet-50 backbone, optimized for object detection.  
- **Dataset**:  
  - Split into training, validation, and test sets.  
  - Prepared and annotated using Roboflow.  
- **Web Interface**:  
  - A Python-based web application (`predictwithweb.py`) for interactive predictions.  
  - Allows uploading images or videos for three-wheel car detection.  
- **Pretrained Weights**: The model leverages pretrained weights (`resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5`) for transfer learning.  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/three-wheel-car-detection.git
   cd three-wheel-car-detection
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. Set up `keras-retinanet`:  
   Navigate to the `keras-retinanet` directory and install the RetinaNet implementation:  
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```  

4. Run the web application:  
   Start the prediction web interface:  
   ```bash
   python predictwithweb.py
   ```  

5. Test the model:  
   Use the included `video5.mp4` or provide custom input files for inference.

## Usage  

### Training the Model  
1. Prepare the dataset in the appropriate format. Refer to `README.dataset` for details.  
2. Train the model using the training dataset:  
   ```bash
   python keras-retinanet/train.py --backbone resnet50 --weights resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5 train/  
   ```  

3. Monitor training using snapshots saved in the `snapshots` folder.  

### Prediction  
1. Use the `predictwithweb.py` script to make predictions through a web interface.  
2. Alternatively, run the prediction on the command line:  
   ```bash
   python keras-retinanet/infer.py --weights models/model_final.h5 --image test/image.jpg  
   ```  

### Evaluation  
Validate the model performance using the `valid/` dataset. Evaluate metrics such as precision and recall.  

## Dataset  
- The dataset is annotated for three-wheel cars using Roboflow.  
- Details on dataset preparation can be found in `README.dataset` and `README.roboflow`.  

## Results  
- **Model Performance**: The model achieved [insert metrics, e.g., mAP, precision, recall] on the validation set.  
- **Sample Predictions**: See predictions in `video5.mp4` for real-world detection examples.  

## Future Improvements  
- Extend the model to detect additional vehicle types.  
- Optimize the model for faster inference on edge devices.  
- Deploy the web interface as a standalone application.
