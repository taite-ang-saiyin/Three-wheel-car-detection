The dataset includes 1116 images.
Three_wheel are annotated in retinanet format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -24 and +24 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -33 and +33 percent
